// Your app should show a count of the tasks. Either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both)
// You should have a score of at least 95 in Lighthouse
// Add a timestamp for each task indicating when it was created. The timestamp should be displayed as a formatted date but stored as a raw date. You can use a third-party library, such as date-fns or Moment.js for this.
// Add a complete all button to set all tasks as completed
// Add a date input to your new task form to set a due date on a task. It could be required, or optional - it's up to you. You could then display this in the list and style it differently when a task is overdue.
